Hi , I'm Hishma Ziauddin . I am a Data Science and Data Analytics undergrad student .
I love exploring the form , shape and functionality of products hence passionate about blending design with technology to enhance everyday products .
These small internship oppurtunities help me build my small projects of dealing with data . And analyse this data to enhance product design. 

I believe that the Power of data can be responsible to mold our daily products and I see design as the key to unlock those potentials. 
My goal is to create solutions that improve everyday life by seamlessly combining form, function, and empirical evidence.
